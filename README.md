Marketing
=========

Prototype software primarily used for learning how to code in Node, Express, Mongo

Running
-------

install `mongodb`, `node.js`, `npm`, `express`. Now change to the `marketing` directory and run: `$ npm install -d`. Starting up is as simple as: `$ npm app.js`

NOTE: the node.js server is configured to listen on localhost:3000. It also assumes a mongodb running on localhost:27017. Both these settings can be changed in `app.js`
